<h1>Best TV shows of all time according to Neri.</h1>

<h2>My top five favorite TV shows.
</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Teen wolf</h3>

<p>This one is a tv show. It features paranormal activity. 
It shows warewolves and all the paranormal creatures associated with it.
I like this movie because it has a fully detailed story with amazing plot twists.
The graphics are also superb and realistic.</p>

<h3>2. Game of Thrones</h3>

<p>This is also a tv show. I like how detailed and well-built the plot of this show is.
You literally can't stop yourself from watching.</p>

<h3>3. All American</h3>

<p>This tv show is absolutely amazing. The fact that it is based on a true story does not make it less interesting. 
Instead, it adds to its natural appeal. The movie basically focuses on an adult teenage boy who is struggling 
to secure his future as a football player and that of his fellow black kids in a racist community.</p>

<h3>4. The Mentalist</h3>

<p>This tv show focuses on former con artist who decides to use his elevated IQ to help the police solve different cases while he also tries to solve his 
own mystery. The way the plot of this movie is well developed makes you question reality as you know it.</p>

<h3>5. Dragon Ball Super</h3>

<p>Any one who watched this anime series as a child would argue that it made their childhood.
This anime has all you would want in an anime. The best graphics well devloped characters, a good story, etc. 
It mainly focuses on the saiyan Goku as he continues this endeavor to become the most powerfull warrior in the universe.</p>
